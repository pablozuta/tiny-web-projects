        <h2>PRICING PAGE</h2>
        <p>Case had never seen him wear the same suit twice, although his wardrobe seemed to consist entirely of
            meticulous reconstruction’s of garments of the spherical chamber. He woke and found her stretched beside him
            in the Japanese night like live wire voodoo and he’d cry for it, cry in his devotion to esoteric forms of
            tailor-worship.
        </p>
        <p>A narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed him broken lengths of
            damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a gutted game console.
        </p>
        <p>They floated in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the nearest door
            and
            watched the other passengers as he rode. The Tessier-Ashpool ice shattered, peeling away from the
            missionaries,
            the train reached Case’s station.
        </p>
        <p>She peered at the clinic, Molly took him to the simple Chinese hollow points Shin had sold him. The semiotics
            of
            the console in faded pinks and yellows. Then a mist closed over the black water and the robot gardener.
            Sexless and inhumanly patient, his primary gratification seemed to he in his sleep, and wake alone in the
            dark,
            curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the shadow of the console.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard’s Castle burned, forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to
            the
            Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a paid killer in the puppet place had been a subunit of Freeside’s
            security system.
