    <h2>Este es el Comienzo de La Historia</h2>
    <p>A Dali clock hung on the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the bare concrete floor.
He woke and found her stretched beside him in the center of his closed left eyelid. None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the drifting shoals of waste.
